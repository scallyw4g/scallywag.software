    <h1>SIMD Perlin Noise Part IV</h1>
    <h2>State of the Art</h2>

    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <p>
      As far as I can tell, I came up with a novel technique for optimizing
      the generation of Perlin noise.  This implementation handily beats the
      next-fastest open source implementation I could find, which I think makes
      it the worlds fastest AVX2 Perlin noise implementation.
    </p>


    <h3>Preface</h3>
    <p>
      I didn't expect there to be a fourth part in this series, but hey, I had
      an idea while I was napping the other day, so here we are.  Let's get right into it.
    </p>

    <h3>i am spd</h3>
    <p>

      The cute idea I had is that the 3D matrix of output is effectively the product
      of three 1D vectors of information.  The vectors are just some values
      that stay constant across their entire row, column or channel, depending
      on the axis.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, taking a look at some pseudo-code from the main loop:
    </p>

    <code>

      struct perlin_params
      {
        u32_8x P0;
        u32_8x P1;
        f32_8x Fract0;
        f32_8x Fract1;
        f32_8x Gradient;
      };

      void
      PerlinNoise_avx2_16x( ... )
      {
        ... setup code ...

        for ( s32 z = 0; z < Dim.z; ++ z)
        {
          perlin_params zParams = ComputePerlinParameters(F32_8X(z), PrimeZ);
          for ( s32 y = 0; y < Dim.y; ++ y)
          {
            perlin_params yParams = ComputePerlinParameters(F32_8X(y), PrimeY);

            perlin_params xParams[2];
            for ( s32 x = 0; x < Dim.x; x += 16)
            {
              _x0 = { ... compute strided x   coordinates ... };
              _x1 = { ... compute strided x+8 coordinates ... };
              xParams[0] = ComputePerlinParameters(_x0, PrimeX);
              xParams[1] = ComputePerlinParameters(_x1, PrimeX);

              PerlinNoise_16x_avx2(xParams, yParams, zParams, Dest);
            }
          }
        }
      }

    </code>

    <p>
      The thing to notice here is that the result of ComputePerlinParameters
      for the x, y and z coordinates remains constant across the entire block
      of output.  The observation about the current loop configuration is that
      we needlessly re-compute the x parameters every time we stride through
      the array in y or z.  Furthermore, we're doing ComputePerlinParameters
      inside the hot loop, which is going to pollute the instruction cache,
      even if it's not particularly frequently.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, instead of computing the perlin_params inputs inside the hot loop,
      we can pull them out and pre-compute all the parameters for the entire
      output block, then just loop through the pre-computed parameter 'vectors'
      to do the product.
    </p>

    <code>

      struct perlin_params
      {
        u32_8x P0;
        u32_8x P1;
        f32_8x Fract0;
        f32_8x Fract1;
        f32_8x Gradient;
      };

      void
      PerlinNoise_avx2_8x( ... )
      {
        ... setup code ...

        perlin_params zParams[Dim.z];
        for ( s32 z = 0; z < Dim.z; ++ z)
          zParams[z] = ComputePerlinParameters(F32_8X(z), PrimeZ);

        perlin_params yParams[Dim.y];
        for ( s32 y = 0; y < Dim.y; ++ y)
          yParams[y] = ComputePerlinParameters(F32_8X(y), PrimeY);

        perlin_params xParams[Dim.x/8];
        for ( s32 x = 0; x < Dim.x; ++ x)
          f32_8x xCoords = { ... compute strided x coordinates ... };
          xParams[x] = ComputePerlinParameters(xCoords, PrimeX);

        for ( s32 z = 0; z < Dim.z; ++ z)
        {
          for ( s32 y = 0; y < Dim.y; ++ y)
          {
            for ( s32 x = 0; x < Dim.x; x += 8)
            {
              PerlinNoise_8x_avx2(xParams[x/8], yParams[y], zParams[z], Dest);
            }
          }
        }
      }

    </code>

    <p>
      This is starting to look pretty tight, and the profile agrees.

    <p>
      By pulling the parameter computation out of the hot loop we were able to
      go back to 8-wide, instead of 16-wide, in the hot loop and managed a 13% speedup.
    </p>

    <p>
      I tried a few other things during this time that ended up being dead ends.
      Most notably I attempted an alternative formulation to the 3-way blend:
    </p>

    <code>
        // Instead of the giant lerp-fest, which has dependency chains ...

        auto L0  = Lerp8x(perlinX->Fade, G0, G1);
        auto L1  = Lerp8x(perlinX->Fade, G2, G3);
        auto L2  = Lerp8x(perlinX->Fade, G4, G5);
        auto L3  = Lerp8x(perlinX->Fade, G6, G7);

        auto L4  = Lerp8x(perlinY->Fade, L0, L1);
        auto L5  = Lerp8x(perlinY->Fade, L2, L3);

        auto Res = Lerp8x(perlinZ->Fade, L4, L5);

        // I tried this giant mul-add fest, which turned out to be slower.
        // Presumably the instruction pipelines are full, so eliminating dependencies
        // at the cost of more instructions doesn't get us any further at this point.

        // V000 (1 - x) (1 - y) (1 - z) +
        // V100      x  (1 - y) (1 - z) +
        // V010 (1 - x)      y  (1 - z) +
        // V001 (1 - x) (1 - y)      z  +
        // V101      x  (1 - y)      z  +
        // V011 (1 - x)      y       z  +
        // V110      x       y  (1 - z) +
        // V111      x       y       z

        auto Res = G0*G2*G4 +
                   G1*G2*G4 +
                   G0*G3*G4 +
                   G0*G2*G5 +
                   G1*G2*G5 +
                   G0*G3*G5 +
                   G1*G3*G4 +
                   G1*G3*G5;

    </code>

    <p>
      So, there you have it.  We went 102 cycles/cell in the first part of this
      series to just 5.56 cycles/cell and a state-of-the-art implementation.
      All in all, we got a total speedup of 18.5x, and beat the current state
      of the art by 1.8x
