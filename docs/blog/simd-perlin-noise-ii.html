    <h1>SIMD Perlin Noise Part II</h1>
    <h2>AVX Strikes Back!</h2>

    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <p>
      Moved from SSE to AVX.  Looked at FastNoise2 for tricks.  Found some ;)
    </p>


    <h3>Preface</h3>
    <p>
      If you didn't catch the first part of this series where we vectorized
      with SSE, check out <a href="/vim/blog/simd-perlin-noise">SIMD Perlin Noise: Beating the compiler with SSE!</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving from 128-wide SSE to 256-wide AVX should be pretty straight forward.
      We'd expect another 2x speedup, since we're now going to process twice
      as many elements.
    </p>

    <h3>First Steps</h3>
    <p>
      Our current implementation is a direct port of Perlin noise to 4-wide SSE
      instructions.  Porting to AVX should be a matter of making 8-wide datatypes
      and using the <code class='inline'>_mm256_</code> instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, after copying <code class='inline'>simd_sse.h</code> to <code class='inline'>simd_avx.h</code>
      and hooking up <a href='https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai_stdlib/blob/master/src/simd_avx2.h'>the new instructions</a>,
      we're ready for some more gains!!
    </p>

      <figcaption> Baseline: 36.2  cycles/cell</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      BOOM.  That's some good speedup right there.
    </p>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
      Well, there's one extremely likely suspect which we didn't talk about much
      last time, which is the data setup before actually computing the noise value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we continue, a brief note on the Perlin noise algorithm.  The basic
      idea is that if you hash points in space, you can compute gradients from
      those hashes in a stable way across cells.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's take a closer look.
    </p>

    <code>
  u32 Xi = u32(x) & 255;
  u32 Yi = u32(y) & 255;
  u32 Zi = u32(z) & 255;

  u32 A  = (u32)Global_PerlinIV[Xi]  + Yi;
  u32 AA = (u32)Global_PerlinIV[A]   + Zi;

  // .. more similar table lookups ..


  // These are the hash values used to compute gradients
  u32 H0 = Global_PerlinIV[AA];
  u32 H1 = Global_PerlinIV[AB];

  // .. more similar table lookups ..
    </code>

    <p>
      Right, so, we're using a series of table lookups to hash points.  Not only
      do these not vectorize well, but the loads are largely dependent on one
      another.  Meaning, subsequent loads depend on the value of previous lookups!
      This is a bad situation to be in if you're trying to maximize throughput.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not to worry!  We now know we're just trying to compute a hash value from
      a point in space.  Question is, can we use .. any hash function we want?
    </p>

    <p>
      As it turns out, we can!  I cracked open the source of <code class='inline'>FastNoise2</code>
      at this point to see how Jordan does it.  Turns out, he uses a pretty simple
      hashing function.  I'm not totally sure why, but the inputs were also
      multiplied or offset by large prime numbers prior to hashing.  I'm going
      to start by trying out this implementation and seeing what it gets us.
    </p>

    <code>
    template<typename SIMD = FS, typename... P>
    FS_INLINE static int32v HashPrimes( int32v seed, P... primedPos )
    {
        int32v hash = seed;
        hash ^= (primedPos ^ ...);

        hash *= int32v( 0x27d4eb2d );
        return (hash >> 15) ^ hash;
    }
    </code>

    <p>
      After futzing around a little bit (and fixing a couple minor bugs) ..
    </p>

      <figcaption> Baseline: 36.2  cycles/cell</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      And there you have it folks!  Got a 2x speedup from going to AVX, and
      eliminating data dependencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      This begs the question, how fast is <code class='inline'>FastNoise2</code>,
      and how fast can we possibly get?  Stay tuned for the conclusion to this
      epic saga in Part III!
